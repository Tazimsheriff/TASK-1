# TASK-1
MY FIRST TASK OF CREATING A LANDING PAGE 

I created a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript function.
First, I made two files: index.html for the webpage structure and style.css for the styling.
In index.html, I added the main sections:
Header with logo, navigation links, and a mobile hamburger menu
Hero section with a background image, heading, text, and a CTA button
Footer with my Instagram, LinkedIn, and Contact (Gmail) links
A dark mode toggle using a simple JavaScript function

In style.css, I styled the layout using:
Flexbox for header and navigation
Background image and overlay for the hero section
Animations like fade-in and slide-up
Media queries to make the layout fully responsive on mobiles and tablets
A dark-mode theme by toggling a class
Button hover effects and modern UI styling

I also used a special Gmail link format to make the Contact button open Gmail in a new tab with the email pre-filled.
Finally, I opened the project with Live Server in VS Code and tested responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
